# Matplotlib et al

In this repo you will find all notebooks for my talk on Monday 26.06.2017.

To view them simply open them inside github.
To woke with them clone this repo and make sure you have `jupyter notebook`
installed. 
If this is not the case just follow the instructions
on [jupyter notebook repo](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) or run
'''bash
sudo pip install notebook
'''

Then to start the notebook navigate inside the repo and run
'''bash
jupyter notebook
'''
A browser will open where the notebooks should be visible. Clicking them will
open them.
